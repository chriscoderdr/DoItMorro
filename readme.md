## Getting Started

To set up the **DoItMorro** project locally, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:
1. [Node.js (via nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm): Recommended version as specified in `.nvmrc`.
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): For running backend services, the web app, and the PostgreSQL database.
3. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): Package manager for installing dependencies.
4. [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client): Mobile app for testing the project on Android or iOS devices.

### **Setup Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chriscoderdr/doItMorro.git
   cd doItMorro
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to each application directory (`apps/api` and `apps/frontend`) and install dependencies individually:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd apps/api
     yarn install
     ```
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     yarn install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` files from the `apps/api` and `apps/frontend` directories.
   - Rename them to `.env` and configure them with your environment-specific settings:
     - `.env.development` for local development.
     - `.env.staging` for testing environments.
     - `.env.production` for production.

4. **Run the Application**:

   - **Backend and Web** (via Docker Compose):
     Use Docker Compose to start the backend and web app along with the PostgreSQL database:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

   - **Mobile (via Expo)**:
     Navigate to the `apps/frontend` directory and start the Expo development server:
     ```bash
     cd apps/frontend
     yarn start
     ```
     This will display a QR code in the terminal. Use the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and run the app.

### **Access the App**
- **Web**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the web app.
- **API**: Access the backend API at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
- **Mobile**: Use the **Expo Go** app to scan the QR code generated by the Expo server and test on your mobile device.
